<p>On August 8th and 7th, I jumped into a ginormous red puddle for fun, and got completely soaked. The puddle was red because of the sand in the park. On the pathway, there was another smaller red puddle draining its water into the major one. I helped TAQ clear the draining trench, so it could drain faster. As far as I can know, the puddle went up to my hip. I was at first scared when I first jumped in to the puddle. Then, when I jumped into the puddle, I wanted to do it again. The second time I did it, I tripped and fell. Fortunately, I caught myself on my butt, instead of falling head-first into the puddle. If I had done that, I would have been lying in the puddle. Truly, that was a scary, fun adventure to me.</p>
